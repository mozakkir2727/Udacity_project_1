## Motivations
* Business Problem :- 
There is an ever-increasing focus on effective recruitment. An organization invests a lot of its time and resources in search of the potential candidates. The investment become loses if the selected candidates do not join the organization in the end.
* Objective :- 
The objective of the analysis is to predict whether the dependent variable is to classify whether the potential customer will join with the organization or not? 

## File Desriptions
Pose at least three questions related to business or real-world applications of how the data could be used.

1. The recruiters need to identify the chances of the potential candidates of joining the organization even before shortlisting their resumes for the interview process.

2. Numerous factors that can make a candidate back out from the job he/she is being selected for.

3. Difficulty to obtain a candidate's profile and employment records as the information is confidential and not easily available.

## Acknowledgements
Attached the data set
Thank you to the Udacity team for creating this project and associated lessons.

## Results
The prediction accuracy is 100%.
Precision and Recall are also 100%.
By the results, the predictions appear to be more biased. So we shall consider Logistic regression as better option for out problem.
