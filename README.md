## Installations
I have install the Python 3.6 version and import the library as following.
1.	Libraries:
2.	Pandas.
3.	Scikit-learn.
4.	numpy.
5.	matplotlib.
6.	seaborn.


## Motivations
This is an Udacity Nanodegree project For this project, I am in using Stack Overflow data from 2017 to better understand
## a) Business Problem :- 
For this project, I am using Stack Overflow data from 2017 to better understand:
As a programmer, should I go to work in the western world (e.g. America, Europe, etc.) or remain in the eastern world (e.g. India, China, etc.)?This is an Udacity Nanodegree project.I was interested in using Stackoverflow Developer Survey Data to better understand:
1.	What is the salary difference in the western world and in the eastern world?
2.	Are there more jobs opportunity in the western world than that in the eastern world?
3.	How are the programmers satisfying about their job between these two sides of the world?

## b)Prepare data:
The data comes from the stack overflow 2017 survey .It contains data that comes as numerical, categorical and text. It has missing values and outliers as well. the rows are the different respondants to the survey, and the columns are the answer to the survey questions. .

## c) Build Model:
I graphed different behaviors that were relevant to the above three questions, with the python libraries matplotlib and seaborn.


## File Desriptions
The notebook available here showcases work related to the above questions.
## Acknowledgements
Attached the data set
Thank you to the Udacity team for creating this project and associated lessons.
